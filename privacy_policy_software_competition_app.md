# Privacy Policy

**Last updated:** 15/1/2026

This Privacy Policy explains how **software competition** ("we", "our", or "us") operates with respect to user privacy. The App is designed for software competitions and **does not collect, store, or process personal information** from users.

By using the App, you acknowledge and agree to this Privacy Policy.

Users are not required to create personal accounts or provide identifying details to participate in competitions.

## 2. Competition Data Only

The App may process **non-personal, competition-related data** solely for functionality purposes, such as:
- Software submissions, code files, or project archives
- Automatically generated submission IDs
- Scores, rankings, or evaluation results

This data is **not linked to any identifiable individual** and is used only to run and manage competitions.

## 3. No Tracking or Analytics

We do not use:
- Cookies
- Tracking pixels
- Third-party analytics tools
- Advertising or behavioral tracking technologies

Any technical data required for basic operation is processed in an anonymous and transient manner.

Although no personal data is collected, we implement reasonable technical and organizational measures to protect competition-related data against unauthorized access, alteration, or loss.

However, no electronic system can be guaranteed to be completely secure.

---

## 5. Data Retention

Competition-related data is retained only for as long as necessary to:

After the competition ends, data may be deleted or archived in an anonymized form.

## 6. Third-Party Services

The App does not share data with third parties except where required for basic infrastructure (such as hosting). Any such service providers do not receive personal information and are obligated to maintain data confidentiality.

## 7. Children’s Privacy

Because no personal information is collected, the App is safe for users of all ages. However, participation is subject to the rules of the specific competition.

## 8. Changes to This Privacy Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Any changes will be posted within the App or on the official competition website. Continued use of the App after changes indicates acceptance of the updated policy.
